## migration-spreadsheet-types - COMPLETED
Create extended cell type for react-spreadsheet (SKUCell interface, SKUMatrix type)

### Key decisions
- Defined CellBase type locally to avoid dependency on uninstalled react-spreadsheet package
- CellBase matches react-spreadsheet's interface: value, readOnly, className
- SKUCell extends CellBase<string | number | null> with dropdownOptions field
- SKUMatrix is (SKUCell | null)[][] to support nullable cells

### Files changed
- src/types/spreadsheet.ts (new)

### Notes
- react-spreadsheet not yet installed (handled by migration-dependencies task)
- CellBase is duplicated locally - will need update once react-spreadsheet installed
