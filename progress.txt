## migration-spreadsheet-adapter - COMPLETED
Create data conversion utilities for react-spreadsheet (convertToSpreadsheetData, convertFromSpreadsheetData)

### Key decisions
- convertToSpreadsheetData transforms CellData[][] to SKUMatrix
- Row 0 (header) cells have no readOnly or dropdownOptions
- Col 0 (SKU) cells for row > 0 get readOnly: true
- Spec columns (col 1+) for row > 0 get dropdownOptions from sorted specifications
- Specifications sorted by order field to match column positions
- Background colors converted to Tailwind-style className (bg-[#hex])
- convertFromSpreadsheetData transforms back, extracting bg from className

### Files changed
- src/lib/spreadsheet-adapter.ts (new)
- src/lib/spreadsheet-adapter.test.ts (new, 15 tests)

### Notes
- Uses SKUCell/SKUMatrix types from migration-spreadsheet-types task
- Handles empty cells, null values, numeric values
- Roundtrip conversion preserves values

## migration-spreadsheet-types - COMPLETED
Create extended cell type for react-spreadsheet (SKUCell interface, SKUMatrix type)

### Key decisions
- Defined CellBase type locally to avoid dependency on uninstalled react-spreadsheet package
- CellBase matches react-spreadsheet's interface: value, readOnly, className
- SKUCell extends CellBase<string | number | null> with dropdownOptions field
- SKUMatrix is (SKUCell | null)[][] to support nullable cells

### Files changed
- src/types/spreadsheet.ts (new)

### Notes
- react-spreadsheet not yet installed (handled by migration-dependencies task)
- CellBase is duplicated locally - will need update once react-spreadsheet installed
